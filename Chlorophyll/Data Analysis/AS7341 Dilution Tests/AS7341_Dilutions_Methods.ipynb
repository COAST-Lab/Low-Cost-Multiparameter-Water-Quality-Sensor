    "# Testing Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1\n",
    "A YSI instrument was calibrated to be used to verify the chlorophyll water sample which would be prepared. Calibration information: https://www.ysi.com/file%20library/documents/manuals/exo-user-manual-web.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2\n",
    "A water sample was prepared with a chlorophyll concentration of 63.5 ug/L and an RFU of 15.8 RFU. This water sample was prepared with rhodamine dye and DI water\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chlorophyll Sample Preparation\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "5mL of Rhodamine dye was pipetted into a 1000mL volumetric flask or beaker. Fill the flask or beaker up to 1000mL mark with DI water\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "Pipette 5mL of the prepared solution in step 1 into a separate 1000mL volumetric flask or beaker. Fill this flask or beaker up to 1000mL mark with DI water. This will be your chlorophyll water sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "Verify the concentration of the prepared chlorophyll water sample with the YSI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Water Dilutions  \n",
    "Create diluted water samples. From the 1000mL stock of 63.5 ug/L chlorophyll water sample prepare water samples diluted to: 50 ug/L, 40 ug/L, 30 ug/L, 20 ug/L, 10ug/L, 8 ug/L, 6 ug/L, 4 ug/L, 2 ug/L, 0.75 ug/L, 0.5 ug/L, 0.25ug/L and 0ug/L. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3\n",
    "Once the diluted water samples are prepared begin testing procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4\n",
    "To begin tests, insert a cuvette filled with DI water into the fluorometer, this will act as your \"blank\". Cover the fluorometer with the box and run for 1 minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5 \n",
    "Stop readings and take the cuvette filled with DI water out of the fluorometer. Insert a cuvette filled with the 0.25 ug/L solution. Cover the fluorometer with the box and run for 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6\n",
    "Repeat the 1 minute tests for each diluted water sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7\n",
    "Stop testing and take the SD card out of the fluorometer and plug it into the computer to begin analysis of the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8\n",
    "This test will be performed first with an LED intensity of 255 and a specififed gain based on the test. \n"
