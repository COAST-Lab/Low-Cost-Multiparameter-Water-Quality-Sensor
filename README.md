# Low-Cost-Multiparameter-Water-Quality-Sesnor

This GitHub repository provides updated designs for a low-cost, open-source, multiparameter water quality sensor. This sensor has the capability of measuring both chlorophyll a
and turbidity levels in water samples. This project is funded by the MOORE Foundation in conjunction with the SOCON (Sustained Ocean Color Observations from Nanosatellites) program. 

Please read the following for a high-level overview of the project and the contents of this repository.
