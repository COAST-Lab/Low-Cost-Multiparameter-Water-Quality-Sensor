# Low-Cost-Multiparameter-Water-Quality-Sesnor

This GitHub repository provides updated designs for a low-cost, open-source, multiparameter water quality sensor. This sensor has the capability of measuring both chlorophyll a
and turbidity levels in water samples. This project is funded by the MOORE Foundation in conjunction with the SOCON (Sustained Ocean Color Observations from Nanosatellites) program. 

Please read the following for a high-level overview of the project and the contents of this repository.

## This is the introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This sensor contains components from low-cost chlorophyll a sensors ("In situ measurements of phytoplankton fluorescence using low cost electronics" Leeuw et al., 2013, 
"Hardware Selection and Performance of Low-Cost Fluorometers" Hixson et al., 2022), as well as low-cost turbidity sensors ("Open-source, low-cost, in-situ turbidity sensor for river network monitoring" Droujko et al., 2022, "Increased scale and accessibility of sediment transport research in rivers through practical, open-source turbidity and depth sensors" Langhorst et al., 2023). Both chlorophyll a and turbidity components were integrated to make a singular benchtop sensor capable of measuring both chlorophyll a and 
turbidity in water samples. 

This repository contains information on the design of this sensor as well as data regarding its measurements of water samples and possible applications for future
deployment in participatory science networks. This sensor a Particle Argonr, an Adafruit Adalogger Featherwing for local data storage, an AS7341 light sensor, an AW9523 LED driver, multiple LEDs, and a water-resistant enclosure.
